This code describes the calculation of additive genetic variance for lifetime fitness, mean fitness, predicted change in fitness, and double bootstrap code to generate confidence intervals. 





Code and data for calculation of additive genetic variance for lifetime fitness, mean fitness, predicted change in fitness (rate of adaptation), and calculation of confidence intervals.
